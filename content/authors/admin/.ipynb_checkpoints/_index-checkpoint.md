Myeong Seop Song is a postdoctoral fellow in the CCS lab. He received his B.A. in Bio & Brain engineering from Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) and Ph.D. in neuroscience from École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL). He has investigated how humans can embody (immerse) in the virtual environment and how embodiment (immersion) can influence perceptions, behaviors, and subjective experiences from the perspective of neuroscience. For these purposes, he has combined various state-of-the-art technologies such as virtual reality, haptics, and robotics with knowledge and methods in neuroscience. He is interested in how embodiment (immersion) and social interactions in the virtual environment can influence human’s decision making and would like to apply computational modeling to this topic for quantitative explanations.
